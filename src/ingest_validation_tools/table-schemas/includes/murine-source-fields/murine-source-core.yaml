fields:
- name: strain
  description: Jackson Labs nomenclature. When mutant alleles are part of the strain name, use "<" and ">" to indicate the superscripted alleles. For example, C57BL/6J-KitW-39J should be entered as "C57BL/6J-Kit<W-39J>", where "W-39J" would be the portion of the string displayed as superscripted text.
